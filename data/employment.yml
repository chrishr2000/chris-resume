Every BI Box connects to the corresponding EPDW system through DB Connect and complex data staging is accomplished through views based on intricate joins of DB tables as per Business requirements. Hierarchies displayed by Cognos runtime have been completely redesigned in BW. ABAP generated eight level hierarchies build based on converted SQL Logics in BW. Master data staging in ODS is present for critical hierarchies. A Customized Selective Deletion Tool has also been designed to handle incorrect/Duplicate data issues. Fine Tuned and efficient Process Chain Design enabled segregating different process types in each local chain. Usage of Meta chains and email alerts through TCode SCOTT is prevalent in this landscape. Exception reporting for reconciliation has been implemented in various modules. Highly complicated remapping logic for mapping SAP accounts to ECCS accounts has been achieved through Start Routines.
